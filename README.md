# Simple Search for Obsidian

A lightweight search plugin for Obsidian that provides basic text search functionality across your vault without any indexing overhead. Search for text in real-time as you type using simple string-matching utilities.

### Why was this made?

This plugin aims to be a lightweight alternative to Omnisearch. While I use Omnisearch in most cases, it caused Obsidian to work more slowly on some of the devices I use, so I developed this alternative to achieve a similar result only using conventional searching without indexing the vault.
